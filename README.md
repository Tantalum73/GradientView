# GradientView
A UIView that shows a linear gradient. Can be used in InterfaceBuilder.

##Usage
1. Import ```GradientView.swift``` into you project.

2. Place a UIView in the InterfacBuilder and assign its class to ```GradientView```.

3. There is no step three.

If you prefer writing you interface in code, don't be afraid to do so since the GradientView also works fine using ```GradientView(frame: CGRect)```


##Customization

Of course, you can adjust the colors of the gradient.
In addition to that, feel free to experiment with ```startX```, ```startY```, ```endX``` and ```endY``` to specify parameters of the gradient.
